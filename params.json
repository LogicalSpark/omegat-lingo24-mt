{"name":"Omegat-lingo24-mt","tagline":"OmegaT plugin for Lingo24 Premium MT API","body":"# Lingo24 Premium MT Plugin for OmegaT\r\n\r\nThis project contains a plugin for the [OmegaT](http://www.omegat.org/) translation memory tool to allow it to source\r\nmachine translation options from the [Lingo24 Premium MT API](https://developer.lingo24.com/), taking advantage of their\r\ndedicated vertical engines.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nIn order to make use of this plugin, you must register for a [Lingo24 Premium MT API] (https://developer.lingo24.com/)\r\naccount and have an active plan. There are a number of paid plans as well as a free taster plan.\r\n\r\nOnce you have created an account, you can download the Zip file and extract its contents into your OmegaT installation's\r\nplugins folder.\r\n\r\nTo use the plugin you must provide OmegaT with the user_key for your Developer Account by adding the following argument\r\nto your OmegaT launch script, replacing the 'XXXX' with your key:\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   -Dlingo24.api.key=XXXX\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nFinally, in OmegaT you can enable or disable the plugin using **Options > Machine Translate > Lingo24 Premium MT**.\r\nWhen enabled, machine translations suggestions will appear in the Machine Translation pane of the editor.\r\n\r\n# Building\r\n\r\nFrom the top level of the repo run the following command:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   mvn install\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis will then create two files in the `target` folder; a Jar file containing the plugin, and a Zip file containing the\r\nplugin and licence for distribution.\r\n\r\nTo use the plugin directly simply copy the `omegat-lingo24-mt-*.jar` to your local OmegaT installations plugin folder.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you can distribute the Zip file to end uses to allow them to unzip the file into their OmegaT installations\r\nplugin folder.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis project is distributed under the [GNU General Public License, v3]\r\n(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).\r\n\r\nThis project makes use of the Groovy Json library licenced under the Apache Licence 2.0.
